1-Appium'da test yazılıp, bu testler için try catch kullanılarak FileNotFundException, NullPointerException vb. exceptionlar için exception handling yapılacak.<br>
-Extra Puan için dileyenler Capability Check yapabilir. (Gerçekten json dosyasından aldığım cihazı mı test ediyorum?)<br>
2-Contact Manager uygulamasının senaryoları yazılacak. https://github.com/movilidadagil/ContactManagerAPIProject <br>
3-Charles Proxy araştırılacak. (Optional-İsteyen araştırabilir, zorunlu değil)<br>
Not: Bu ödevde README.md dosyalarınızın özenli olmasını bekliyor olacağız.

-Charles Proxy: Charles Web Debugging Proxy is a cross-platform HTTP/HTTPS debugging proxy server application written in Java. The mobile or web browser is configured to access to internet via Charles, to save and display all the data sent and received for you. In web or mobile applications development, you can't see what is sent and received between your web browser/mobile application and the server. Without this visibility, it is difficult and rather time consuming to determine where the fault exists. Charles makes it easy to see what's being sent between your web browser/mobile app and the server so you can quickly find and fix problems.

-In this assignment, tests of ongoing scenarios related to Android ContactManager were written in Appium, and exception handling was attempted by using try catch for these tests.

-In the Appium test, first a code was written to get the project up and then separate classes were created to reveal various scenarios.

-In these classes, tests were written for separate tabs.

-In this assignment, the codes from the previous lesson were also used because it was tried to continue the tests related to the ongoing requirements.
